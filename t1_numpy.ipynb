    "## Tutorial on NumPy arrays\n",
    "Basic mathematical functions (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root) on $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ operate elementwise on arrays. Recall that element-wise operations are straightforward for vectors: for vectors $\\boldsymbol{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b} = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n)$, element-wise addition, $\\boldsymbol{a} + \\boldsymbol{b}$, is simply $a_i + b_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. The same is true for other element-wise arithmetic operations.  Element-wise operations generalize to $m \\times n$ arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, basic arithmetic operations are available both as operator overloads -- meaning for example that `+` will behave elementwise when the operands are arrays and as a normal binary operator when the operands are scalars-- or as specific methods that run in the numpy module. Below, you will see examples of each."
